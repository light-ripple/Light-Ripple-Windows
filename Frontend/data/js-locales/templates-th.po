# This is a quote of UNDERTALE if you didn't know.
# It is shown regarding the level of an user, but it is shortened to "Lv.".
# Of course, this means Level on Ripple, but in UNDERTALE, it actually means LOVE.
# I'm not gonna spoil you why it's called LOVE.
# It's hard to keep this cultural reference, so you can also just write the
# translation for "Level" in this.
